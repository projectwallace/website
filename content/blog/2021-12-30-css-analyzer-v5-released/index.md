With a few hours left before the end of the year I am happy to announce that `@projectwallace/css-analyzer` is now on version 5! It is a complete rewrite of the previous version. The TL;DR:

- More metrics added
- Existing metrics are more detailed
- Less dependencies (faster installation)
- Runs faster
- Browser compatible

If you're in a hurry, go grab it [on GitHub](https://github.com/projectwallace/css-analyzer) or run `npm install @projectwallace/css-analyzer`.

## New features 🥳

- The most exciting feature of all: **see where colors are defined!** It's cool to see all the unique colors in a list, but it's even better to see that `background` uses 3 different colors, whereas `color` uses 12!
- Metrics like _selectors per rule_ now have a full list detailing the amount of selectors/declarations per rule. This means you can now graph out these metrics and that's exactly what I'm doing on [the online analyzer](/analyze-css);
- For many metrics I've added the **mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum and sum** of that metric. That means that you can now see what the most common specificity of a selector is, or the highest complexity of a selector, or the maximum amount of selectors in a single rule;
- You can now see all the **CSS units** that are used in the CSS. Whether they are `rem`, `px` or even `vmin`: it's all visible now. And you can even see if `font-size` is using more `px` than `em` or that `transition-duration` only uses `s` instead of `ms` ;)

## Migration from v4 to v5 🪜

- Drop support for Node 8 and 10 (see [Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/))
- Rename all metrics ending on `.share` to `.ratio`
  <br>This is only a better word for the exact metric;
- Rename `stylesheets` to `stylesheet`
  <br>Because we're always analyzing exactly one stylesheet;
- Remove `stylesheets.simplicity`
  <br>This is now `rules.declarations.mean`
- Remove `stylesheets.cohesion`
  <br>This is now `rules.selectors.mean`
- Remove `stylesheets.browserhacks.*`, `atrules.supports.browserhacks.*`, `atrules.mediaqueries.browserhacks.*`, `selectors.browserhacks.*`, `values.browserhacks.*`
  <br>These are hard to maintain because they relies on _a lot_ of complex regexes.
- Remove `atrules.documents.*`
  <br>This metric added very little value.
- Drop `atrules.namespace.*`
  <br>This metric added very little value.
- Drop `atrules.page.*`
  <br>This metric added very little value.
- Remove `selectors.js.*`
  <br>This metric added very little value.
- Remove `values.total`
  <br>This is the exact same value as `declarations.total`, so use that one instead;
- Remove `values.colors.duplicate.*`
- Add `rules.selectors` mean/median/mode/etc
- Add `rules.declarations` mean/median/mode
- Add `selectors.specificity.*`
- Add `selectors.complexity.*`
- Add `atrules.keyframes.prefixed.*`

## Dependencies 📦

An upcoming trend in Node land is to have a closer look at the `node_modules` of your project. The running gag is to compare `node_modules` to a black hole, but the undertone is more serious: it has gotten out of hand and many projects face insane install times with all the environmental impact that comes along with that. To turn this trend, projects like PostCSS and Vite have gone the route of closely inspecting their dependencies and replacing big libraries with smaller alternatives.

For this project it meant getting rid of a whole list of my own dependencies, as well as swapping existing ones with smaller and faster alternatives.
The biggest change in dependencies is that all existing dependencies have turned into a single dependency: `css-tree`. [CSSTree is amazing](https://github.com/csstree/csstree) and I am a big fan of the work of CSSTree's author [Roman Dvornov](https://github.com/lahmatiy).

For devDependencies, I've replaced Ava with Uvu (by [Luke Edwards](https://github.com/lukeed/)). [Uvu is insanely fast](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) and I find it easier to use than Ava because it doesn't rely on magical global variables.

## Conclusion

Let's hope this new version can serve the community well the next couple of years. The [previous version that ran on PostCSS was released in 2017](/blog/css-analyzer-now-postcss), so I hope there's not another big rewrite for the next couple of years. Enjoy!
